## üî• End-to-End Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Upload raw retail transaction data and competitor listing data into **Azure Blob Storage** under `/raw/`.

2. **ETL & Feature Engineering**
   - Use **Azure Data Factory** or **PySpark notebooks** to:
     - Clean product descriptions
     - Extract structured attributes (e.g., brand, unit price)
     - Compute derived features like `rating_score`

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Train an **XGBoost classifier** to predict whether a product should:
     - Raise Price
     - Drop Price
     - Retain Price
   - Features used: `UnitPrice`, `Quantity`, `Rating`, `rating_score`

4. **Model Deployment**
   - Upload the trained model (`price_classifier.pkl`) to Azure Blob Storage
   - Save price predictions (`price_predictions.parquet`) in Blob Storage for dashboard consumption

5. **Front-End Dashboard**
   - Build a **Streamlit** application to:
     - Allow users to filter by store, product, and recommendation
     - Display KPIs (e.g., overpriced count)
     - Visualize recommendations in charts and tables

6. **LLM Integration for Explainability**
   - Integrate **Azure OpenAI Service** to:
     - Generate short explanations for why a product's price recommendation was made
     - Dynamically create natural language output for selected products in the dashboard

7. **Deployment**
   - Host the dashboard on **Azure App Service**
   - Secure API keys and blob connection strings through Azure App Settings
   - Automate deployments via **GitHub Actions**
